CS1D Project 1

## Coding Standards

### Namespaces
* Use scope resolution operator (no `using namespace std`)

### Variables
* Descriptive names

### Functions
* Opening bracket on following line for functions only

Example:
```
void func()
{
```

```
if (boolVal) {
```

### Classes
* Name classes to begin with a capital letter
* Follow encapsulation paradigm (keep data members and helper functions private)

### Misc.
* Include guards in header file
* Test build and features before pushing to avoid compilation errors or crashes
* Verify data from file after implementation
* Descriptive commit messages

## Team Rules
* Notify others before working on a user story
* Let others know when you've completed something
* No fighting
