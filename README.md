### CS1D Project 1

*Your team is to write a C++ program that reads data and stores it in a data structure of your choice. Your program must have the ability to hold the names of at least 20 college campuses (the initial data contains 11 campuses) and their corresponding traditional souvenirs (up to six per campus). Your program will be used to allow perspective college students to plan their college experience. Your team will need to provide the ability to modify information related to the traditional souvenirs (such as adding new souvenirs, changing a price of a souvenir, or deleting a souvenir).*
