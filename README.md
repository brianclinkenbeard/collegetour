CS1D Project 1

## Coding Standards

### Namespaces
* use scope resolution operator (no `using namespace std`)

### Variables
* descriptive names

### Functions
* opening bracket on following line for functions only

Example:
```
void func()
{
```

```
if (boolVal) {
```

### Classes
* start with a capital letter
* follow encapsulation paradigm (keep data members and helper functions private)

### Misc.
* include guards in header file
* test build and features before pushing to avoid compilation errors or crashes
* verify data from file after implementation
* descriptive commit messages

## Team Rules
* notify others before working on a user story
* let others know when you've completed something
* no fighting
